# Binary Trees

- Try to implement iterative solutions as well

## todo revision

- [ ] zigzag level order ( 2 stack method ? )
- [ ] populate next sibling for all nodes 
- [ ] Least Common Ancestors ( LCA ) of two nodes

## Questions list

Traversals

- [x] DFS - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder - Recursive & Iterative
- [x] BFS - Level Order Traversal, Level Order in Reverse
- [X] zigzag level order
