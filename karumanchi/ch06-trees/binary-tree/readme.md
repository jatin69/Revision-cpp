# Binary Trees

- Try to implement iterative solutions as well

Traversals

- [x] DFS - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder - Recursive & Iterative
- [x] BFS - Level Order Traversal, Level Order in Reverse

Construct Tree from given traversals

- [ ] inorder-preorder-to-tree
- [ ] inorder-postorder-to-tree
- [ ] inorder-levelorder-to-tree

- [x] Size of a tree
- [x] Height / Depth - ( both definitions : Node height, Edge Height )
- [x] Count leaves / Count Full Nodes / Count half-filled Nodes

- [x] Mirror of a Tree
- [x] Check if two trees are mirror of each other / Check if two trees are equal
- [x] Check if Tree is symmetric

- [x] Insert a Node
- [x] check if element exists
- [x] Delete a Node
- [x] Delete tree

- [x] Maximum element Node
- [x] Sum of all elements

- [x] count levels Iterative
- [x] Print nodes of a particular level - Iterative, Recursive
- [ ] Print nodes of all levels
- [ ] Find number of levels
- [ ] Find level with maximum sum
- [ ] Spiral BFS
- [ ] Vertical order/level of Tree
- [ ] Vertical Sums

- [ ] Deepest Node in tree
- [ ] Diameter of a tree
- [ ] Check if path sum exists
- [ ] Print all path sums
- [ ] Print all paths from root to leaves
- [ ] find next sibling for all nodes - recursive & Iterative

- [ ] Left View of Tree
- [ ] Right View of Tree
- [ ] Top View of Tree ???
- [ ] Outer View/Bound of Tree

- Double the tree
- All ancestors of a Node
- Least Common Ancestors ( LCA ) of two nodes
