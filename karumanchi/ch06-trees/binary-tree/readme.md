# Binary Trees

- Try to implement iterative solutions as well

Traversals
- [ ] DFS - Inorder, Preorder, Postorder - Recursive & Iterative
- [ ] BFS - Level Order Traversal, Level Order in Reverse

Construct Tree from given traversals
- [ ] inorder-preorder-to-tree
- [ ] inorder-postorder-to-tree
- [ ] inorder-levelorder-to-tree

- [X] Size of a tree
- [X] Height / Depth - ( both definitions : Node height, Edge Height )
- [X] Count leaves / Count Full Nodes / Count half-filled Nodes

- [X] Mirror of a Tree
- [X] Check if two trees are mirror of each other / Check if two trees are equal
- [X] Check if Tree is symmetric

- [X] Insert a Node
- [X] check if element exists
- [X] Delete a Node
- [X] Delete tree

- [X] Maximum element Node
- [X] Sum of all elements


- [ ] Print nodes of a particular level
- [ ] Print nodes of all levels
- [ ] Find level with maximum sum
- [ ] Spiral BFS
- [ ] Vertical order/level of Tree
- [ ] Vertical Sums

- [ ] Deepest Node in tree
- [ ] Diameter of a tree
- [ ] Check if path sum exists
- [ ] Print all path sums
- [ ] Print all paths from root to leaves
- [ ] find next sibling for all nodes - recursive & Iterative

- [ ] Left View of Tree
- [ ] Right View of Tree
- [ ] Top View of Tree ???
- [ ] Outer View/Bound of Tree

- Double the tree
- All ancestors of a Node
- Least Common Ancestors ( LCA ) of two nodes
