# Bit Manipulation

* [x] [solution](count-set-bits-in-an-integer.cpp) count number of set bits in a number N - O(logN) (Brian Kernighan's method)
* [x] [solution](no-of-bits-needed-to-convert-a-to-b.cpp) No of bit flips needed to convert number A to B - O( max(logA, logB))
* [x] [solution](find-parity-of-an-uint.cpp) Parity of an unsigned integer N - O(logN) (Brian Kernighan's method) and O(1) (lookup table)
* [x] [solution](check-if-number-is-a-power-of-two.cpp) Check if a number N is a Power of 2 - O(1)
* [x] [solution](is-integer-multiple-of-3.cpp) check if an integer N is a multiple of 3 - O(logN)
* [x] [solution](is-binary-number-multiple-of-3.cpp) check if a binary numer of length N (given as string) is a multiple of 3 (same concept as above) - order(N)
* [x] [solution](rotate-bits.cpp) circular Rotate bits of an integer (32 bit rotation) - O(1)
* [x] [solution](reverse-bits-of-a-32-bit-integer.cpp) Reverse bits of an unsigned integer N (32 bit reversal) - O(logN)
* [x] [solution](reverse-bits-of-a-n-bit-integer.cpp) Reverse bits of an unsigned integer N (exact bit reversal) - O(logN)
* [ ] [solution](minimum-xor-value-pair.cpp) Given an array of N integers, find the pair of integers in the array which have minimum XOR value. - O(NLogN)
* [x] [solution](single-occurence-in-swarm-of-2.cpp) Given an array of N integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one. - O(N)
* [ ] [solution](single-occurence-in-swarm-of-3.cpp) Given an array of N integers, every element appears thrice except for one. Find that single one. - O(N)
* [ ] [solution](divide-two-integers-without-using-multiplication-division-mod-operator.cpp) Given a two integers say a and b. Find the quotient after dividing a by b without using multiplication, division and mod operator. O(log a)
* [ ] [solution](different-bits-sum-pairwise.cpp) Given an integer array of n integers, find sum of bit differences in all pairs that can be formed from array elements. Bit difference of a pair (x, y) is count of different bits at same positions in binary representations of x and y.

## Editorials

* [editorial](efficient-count-set-and-parity.cpp) Efficient count set bits and parity. - constant time
* [editorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-xor-value-pair/) Given an array of N integers, find the pair of integers in the array which have minimum XOR value. Report the minimum XOR value. => can be done in O(N) using Trie
