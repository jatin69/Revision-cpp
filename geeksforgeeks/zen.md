Basic does not mean "simple".
Basic means it is a basic algorithm / clear approach, all you need is just to apply it.

------------------------------
- Easy: I can solve on the spot, because the approach is clear to me

- Medium: I can solve it, because the approach is clear to me, but there are some tricky cases or I need to refresh my knowledge

- Hard: I can solve it after thoroughly ruminating on it or I cannot solve it at all w/o any hints
